# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Model
The Hand Gesture Recognition Model is a deep learning project built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify hand gestures from the LeapGestRecog dataset.The trained model can accurately recognize hand gestures, which can be applied in human-computer interaction, sign language translation, gaming, and virtual environments.
